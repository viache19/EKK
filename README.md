# Emergency Knowledge Kit (EKK)

A visual and responsive multimedia library, designed to run efficiently on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W. It allows browsing and viewing multimedia files and folders from any device (PC, tablet, mobile) connected to the local network.

## Features
- Simple and visual navigation through multimedia folders and files (videos, images, audio, PDFs, etc.)
- Modern, responsive interface built with Tailwind CSS
- Compatible with desktops, tablets, and mobile devices
- Breadcrumbs for quick folder navigation
- Highlighted Home button next to the title to return to the root directory
- Direct preview of images and videos, with option to open files in a new tab
- No heavy dependencies: only Flask and Tailwind CDN
- Optimized for low resource consumption and ideal for use on Raspberry Pi Zero 2W

## Folder Structure
Place all your multimedia content inside the `content` folder at the root of the project. You can freely create subfolders. The code will process them automatically without needing any changes.


```
content/
â”œâ”€â”€ Movies/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ movie1.mp4
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ cover.jpg
